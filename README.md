# Pushup-Tracker
This Python script was made because I was bored. It is designed to help you track your pushup workouts easily; allowing you to log the number of pushups you complete in each set, as well as recording the total number of pushups completed each day.

# Features
> Simple Logging: Press Enter to log a set of 15 pushups.

> Date and Time Recording: Automatically records the date and time of each set.

> Daily Summary: Logs the total number of pushups completed at the end of the day.

> Clear Console Output: Provides a clean and updated display of your progress.

> Colorful Feedback: Uses colors to differentiate between normal, successful, and invalid inputs.

# Dependencies

```
pip install colorama
